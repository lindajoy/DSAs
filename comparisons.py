# ðŸ’¡ Returns True if the two memory points => point to the same memory location.
b = a
print(b is a)  # True
print(b == a)  # True

c = [1, 2, 3]
print(c is a)  # False
print(c == a)  # True

# b and a are two variables that point to the same object in memory, so b is a returns True. 
# The == operator also returns True because the values of a and b are the same.
# Always try to use the == sign.
