# The simplest data structure in a contingous block of memory.
# Usually represents sequences.

"""
Simple question:
Your input is an array of integers, and you have to reorder its entries so that the even entries appear first. 
This is easy if you use O(n) space, where n is the length of the array. 
However, you are required to solve it without allocating additional storage.

Sample Input:
Input Array: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]

Sample Output:
Reordered Array: [4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 5, 9, 6, 5, 3]

# ðŸ’¡ The Dutch National Flag Problem
# Hehe, here we revisit the dreaded quicksort algorithm, Divide and Conquer algorithm.

# Write a program that takes an array A and an index i rnto A, 
# and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[r] (the "pivot") appear first, 
# followed by elements equal to the pivot, followed by elements greater than the pivot.

# Suppose array A is equal to A = [0,1,2,0,2,1,1] and the pivot index is 3
# The A[3] = 0, so [0,0,1,2,2,1,1] is valid partioning.
# Mostly Known as the Dutch National Flag
# Where we should return an array that is fully sorted.
# Whenever we are working with the pivot sorting: The one for sure is that we will always be provided with the  pivot index

# Interesting way of assigning variables.

# The above solution, does not sort the array completely.
# But its true to say that its done its job effeciently where all elements that are less
# than the pivot index are on the left
