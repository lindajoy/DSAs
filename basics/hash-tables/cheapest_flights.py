CHEAPEST FLIGHTS WITHIN K STOPS.

There are n cities connected by some number of flights. 
You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [from(i), to(i), price(i)]
indicates that there is a flight from city from(i) to city to(i) with cost price(i)

You are also given three integers src, dst and k, return the cheapest price 
from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1

# Intuition: This means that the stops can be equal or less than k.
