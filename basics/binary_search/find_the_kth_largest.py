ðŸ’¡ FIND THE KTH LARGEST ELEMENT

# ðŸ’¡ Brute Force Solution

# We can easily sort the array in descending order: So that we have something like this:
# [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# The time complexity of this would be O(n log n)
# N is the length of the array/ list ðŸ˜„
# Best case: O(N)

# ðŸ’¡ Using a heap
# Hmm this is an interesting way of solving it. ðŸ¤”

# Pseudocode:
#
#   i) Initialize a heap
#   ii) We push every number into our heap
#   iii) We remove values (This are the smallest elements) from our heap while the length of the heap is greater than k
#   iv) After that is done we return the smallest element which equates to our result.

# What if i was sort the elements in place without completely sorting the array.

# Introducing our subroutine:

# A subroutine is a set of programs that are repeatedly used within a program
# It allows a programmer to reuse a set of instructions in multiple parts of the program.

# Is O(log n) always faster than O(n)? ðŸ¤”
