# üí° Brute Force Solution

# We can easily sort the array in descending order: So that we have something like this:
# [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# N is the length of the array/ list üòÑ

# üí° Using a heap
# Hmm this is an interesting way of solving it. ü§î

# Pseudocode:
#
#   i) Initialize a heap
#   ii) We push every number into our heap
#   iii) We remove values (This are the smallest elements) from our heap while the length of the heap is greater than k
#   iv) After that is done we return the smallest element which equates to our result.

# A subroutine is a set of programs that are repeatedly used within a program

"""
QUICKSORT ALGORITHM: This is a divide and conquer algorithm ü§î

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where:

    1. An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element(element selected element)
       Elements less than the pivot should be positioned in such a way elements are kept on the left side
       and elements greater are on the right side of the pivot
    
    2. The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. The process continues untill each subarray
        cointains a single element

    3. At this point, elements are already sorted. Finally elements are combined to form a sorted array.
