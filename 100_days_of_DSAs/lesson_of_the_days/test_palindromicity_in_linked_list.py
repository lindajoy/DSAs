TEST PALINDROMICITY IN LINKED LIST

Write a program that tests whether a singly linked list is palindromic.

# ðŸ¤” Whats the input? A singly linked list
# ðŸ’¡  Whats the output? Testing out the palindromicity of a linked list.

# Initialize list Node

# Lets define the pseudocode to this issue:

# The process/ Pseudocode is the following:
        
#   Finding the middle and the end.
#   Reversing the second part of the linked list.
#   Comparing the linked list halves

# This approach has a time complexity of O(N) and space complexity of O(1)
        
# If you think about it; the simple questions concerning linked lists are what built up the solution:
        
    # Reversing a linked list: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/
    # Finding the middle node in the linked list: https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/submissions/1173162016/

# I think the trickiest bit on this question, which i am not comfortable with is when it comes to reversing a list: I need to understand it more ðŸ¤”
        

# Lets look at The question on reversing a list.
# Okay lets draw this on excalidraw..ðŸ˜„
