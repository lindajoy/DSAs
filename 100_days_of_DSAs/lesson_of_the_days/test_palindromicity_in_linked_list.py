# ðŸ¤” Whats the input? A singly linked list
# ðŸ’¡  Whats the output? Testing out the palindromicity of a linked list.

# Initialize list Node

# Lets define the pseudocode to this issue:

# The process/ Pseudocode is the following:
        
#   Finding the middle and the end.
#   Reversing the second part of the linked list.
#   Comparing the linked list halves

# This approach has a time complexity of O(N) and space complexity of O(1)
        
# If you think about it; the simple questions concerning linked lists are what built up the solution:
        
    # Reversing a linked list: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/
    # Finding the middle node in the linked list: 

def isPalindrome(head: ListNode):
