"""
Given an array of integers arr and an integer k. 
Find the least number of unique integers after removing exactly k elements.

Say you had:
arr = [5,5,4] k = 1
You can remove 4 so that the length of unique integers is one

Example 2:
arr = [4,3,1,1,3,3,2], k = 3

Remove 4, 2 and either one of the two 1s or three 3s. 1 and 3 will be left.

#   1. Create a dictionary count_dict and store the count of each character in the array and sort them
#   2. Loop the array while the k is greater than 0, decrement the value of k while we loop through the array.
#   3. lastly filter out the values that are greater than 0
#   4. Return the length of x.

A heap is a specialized binary tree.

# FURTHEST BUILDING YOU CAN REACH
"""
You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.
