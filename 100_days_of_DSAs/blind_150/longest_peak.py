ğŸ’¡  LONGEST PEAK

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak in the array.

A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach a tip 
(the highest value in the peak), 
at which point they become strictly decreasing. At least three integers are required to form a peak.

For example, the integers 1, 4, 10, 2 form a peak, 
but the integers 4, 0, 10 don't and neither do the integers 1, 2, 2, 0. 
Similarly, the integers 1, 2, 3 don't form a peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the 3.

# Example 1

# array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]
# 6 // 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3

# Doing this question, because, I dont like it ğŸ¥¶

# What are we given? An array
# What is the output? The length of the longest peak.
