"""
Given an array of integers arr and an integer k. 
Find the least number of unique integers after removing exactly k elements.

Say you had:
arr = [5,5,4] k = 1
You can remove 4 so that the length of unique integers is one

Example 2:
arr = [4,3,1,1,3,3,2], k = 3

Remove 4, 2 and either one of the two 1s or three 3s. 1 and 3 will be left.
"""

# Brute Force Approach would be:
#   1. Create a dictionary count_dict and store the count of each character in the array and sort them
#   2. Loop the array while the k is greater than 0, decrement the value of k while we loop through the array.
#   3. lastly filter out the values that are greater than 0
#   4. Return the length of x.

"""
A heap is a specialized binary tree. 

We use heaps when all we care about is the largest or the smallest elements , and you do not need to support fast lookcup, delete , 
or search oparations for arbitary elements.

A heap is good choice when you need to compute the k largest or k smallest in a collection
