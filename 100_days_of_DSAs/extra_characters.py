"""
You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. 
You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. 
There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.
Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.

Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
Output: 1
