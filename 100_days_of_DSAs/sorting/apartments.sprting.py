"""
Variant A number of apartment buildings are coming up on a new street. 
The postal service wants to place a single mailbox on the street. 
Their objective is to minimize the total distance that residents have to walk to collect their mail each day. 
(Different buildings may have different nurnbers of residents.)
Devise an algorithm that computes where to place the mailbox so as to minimize the total distance,
that residents travel to get to the mailbox. Assume the input is specified as an array of building objects, 
where each building object has a field indicating the number of residents in that building, 
and a field indicating the building's distance from the start of the street.
