"""
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

ðŸ’¡ Example 1

"""
ðŸ’¡ First iteration of solution  => Did the basic minimum:

Considered that for a string to be a valid parentheses the length should always
be divisible by 2, If not it does not qualify to be a valid parenthesis.

And also if the string length is 2, I just compare the first and the second element in
the string.
