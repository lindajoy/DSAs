Pass By Value vs Pass By Reference

In pass by value, the value of a function parameter is copied to another location of the memory.
When accessing or modifying the variable within the function, it accesses only the copy. 
Thus, there is no effect on the original value.

In pass by reference, the memory address is passed to that function. 
In other words, the function gets access to the actual variable.
