DICTIONARY:
    Key => The desired key to lookup
    Value => The value set or return

A dictionary is a key value store is also known as Mapping.
It allows you to store and retrieve elements by referencing a key.
As dictionaries are referenced by key, they have very fast lookups.
As they are primarily used for referencing items by key, they are not sorted
