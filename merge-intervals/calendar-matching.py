"""
Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a co-worker. 
You have access to your calendar and your co-worker's calendar (both of which contain your respective meetings for the day, 
in the form of [startTime, endTime]), as well as both of your daily bounds
(i.e., the earliest and latest times at which you're available for meetings every day, in the form of [earliestTime, latestTime]).

Write a function that takes in your calendar, your daily bounds, your co-worker's calendar, 
your co-worker's daily bounds, and the duration of the meeting that you want to schedule, 
and that returns a list of all the time blocks (in the form of [startTime, endTime]) during which you could schedule the meeting, 
ordered from earliest time block to latest.

Note that times will be given and should be returned in military time. For example: 8:30, 9:01, and 23:56.

Also note that the given calendar times will be sorted by start time in ascending order, 
as you would expect them to appear in a calendar application like Google Calendar.
