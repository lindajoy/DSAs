"""
In this challenge, you will determine whether a string is funny or not. 
To determine whether a string is funny, create a copy of the string in reverse e.g. abc -> bca
Iterating through each string, compare the absolute difference in the ascii values of the characters at positions 0 and 1, 1 and 2 and so on to the end. 
If the list of absolute differences is the same for both strings, they are funny.

Determine whether a give string is funny. If it is, return Funny, otherwise return Not Funny.

Example:

s = "lmnop"

The ordinal values of the characters are [108,109,110,111,112].
s.reverse = "ponml" and the ordinal values are [112,111,110,109,108].
The absolute differences of the adjacent elements for both strings are [1,1,1,1], so the answer is funny
