"""
ðŸ’¡ SORT CHARACTERS BY FREQUENCY

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. 
The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
