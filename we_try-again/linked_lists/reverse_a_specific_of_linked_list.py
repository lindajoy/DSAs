"""
Reverse A Single Sublist

Write a program which takes a singly linked list L and two integers s and / as arguments, and reverses the order of the nodes from the sth node to /th node, inclusive. 
The numbering begins at 1., i.e., the head node is the first node. Do not allocate additional nodes.

# ðŸ’¡ I found this question interesting: Following up on reversing a linked list entirely

# Whats the input? Linked list, starting, finish point
# Whats the output? Linked list; with the modified reversal.

# Hmm the problem is I am not sure I understand..

# Class initializes the components of a linked list.

    dummy_head = sublist_head = ListNode(0,L)

    # Reverse sublist

# Lets go back and assume that it was a list?
# You are given a list, and a starting and ending point of the slice that should be reversed.
# Example: [1,2,3,4], starting = 2, ending = 3
# Output: should be: [1,2,4,3]
# ðŸ’¡ Another example would be:
# [4,5,5,7,8], starting = 2, ending 2
# Remains the same.
