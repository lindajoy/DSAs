ðŸ’¡ REMOVE THE KTH NODE FROM END

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k and removes the kth node from the end of the list.

The removal should be done in place, meaning that the original data structure should be mutated (no new structure should be created).

Furthermore, the input head of the linked list should remain the head of the linked list after the removal is done, 
even if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed. 
In other words, if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed, your function should simply mutate its value and next pointer.

Note that your function doesn't need to return anything.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least two nodes and, more specifically, at least k nodes.

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.

"""

# Example 1

# INPUT

# head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 // the head node with value 0
# k = 4

# Output should be something like this or rather our mutated list should be:
# The 4th node from the end of the list (the node with value 6) is removed.
# 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9

# Solution Idea

"""
The idea here is to use two pointers to find the (N + 1)th from the end.
In the beginning, the first pointer is at the (N + 1)th node from the start, and the second painter is at the head of linked list.
By moving both pointers one step at a time untill the forst point reaches the end, the second pointer will point to the (N + 1)th node from the end, 
and we easily remove the next node, which is the Nth node from the list end.
"""

# SOLUTION STEPS
"""
    1. Initialize two pointers: FirstPointer and Second Pointer.
       Initially, the second pointer is positioned at the first node of the linked list, and the firstPointer is set to the (N + 1)th node from the beginning.
    
    2. Now, both pointers maintain a constant gap of N nodes. We advance them together untill the firstPointer reaches the lastNode.
    3. At this point, the secondPointer points to the (N + 1) th node from the end.
        To remove the Nth node from the end of the list, we update the next pointer of the secondPointer to the point to the next node's next pointer.
