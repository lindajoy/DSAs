# ðŸ’¡ Second implementation(Works better) 
# PSEUDOCODE:
#   1. Get rid of the edge cases, that means that you need to check whether the list has enough elements to loop over
#   2. Initialize the large and the second largest to the element at zero index, Also intialize a set
#      REASON: Sets do not allow duplicate values, So we are getting rid of the chance where our second large and large element might be equal
#       CONSIDER INPUT: 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4
#   3. Loop over the list:
#       i) Check if x and y are equal if they are assign value el to y
#       ii) if el is greater than y , then assign el to y
#       iii) if y is greater than x then you need to swap them
#
# Key takeaway:  Sets' elements are not modifiable, however the set itself is modifiable ðŸ¤¯

# ðŸ’¡ Solution 3: Traversing the list twice.
# Pseudocode:
# 1. Initialize first_max and second_max to infinity
# 2. Loop through the list to initialize the first_max
# 3. Loop through the list again initialize the second_max
# The time complexity here is O(N)2 => QUADRATIC COMPLEXITY because we have two loops; Traverse the 
# List twice.
