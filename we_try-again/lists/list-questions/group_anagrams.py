"""
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. 
You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1: 
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:
Input: sts = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
