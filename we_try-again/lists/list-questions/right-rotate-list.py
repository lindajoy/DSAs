This should be reviewed:

Implement a function right_rotate(lst, k) which will rotate the given list by k. 
This means that the right-most elements will appear at the left-most position in the list and so on. 
You only have to rotate the list by one element at a time.

Input: [10,20,30,40,50]
k = 3
Sample Output: [30,40,50,10,20]
"""

"""
ðŸ¤” Question for interviewer: 
1. What if k is greater than the length of the list?
2. Will the list contain strings/integers?
3. Is it possible that we have or encounter an empty list as our input?

Ask a clarifying question.

So example: Given this input: [10,20,30,40,50]
k = 1

Shoud our output be: [20,30,40,50,10] ?

A good question to look at: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/
