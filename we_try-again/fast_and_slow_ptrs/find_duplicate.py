Given an unsorted array of positive numbers, nums, such that the values lie in the range [1,n]
,inclusive, and that there are n+1 numbers in the array, find and return the duplicate number present in nums. 
There is only one repeated number in nums.

Note: You cannot modify the given array nums. You have to solve the problem using constant extra space.

# ===> MIND BLOWING ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

# Something to note in this question is that there is only one repeated number in nums.
# ðŸ’¡ So whenever, we are just looking for one number ðŸ¤”
# The best solution would be to use a set and find the duplicate.

# But I think the trick here is, You cannot modify the array itself, 
# You have to solve the problem using only extra space!!!

# Discovering that you can use Fast and slow pointers in this question..

        slow = nums[slow]

        # Move the fast pointer two times faster as the slow pointer
        fast = nums[nums[fast]]

        # Break the loop when the slow pointer becomes equal to the first pointer
        if slow == fast:
            break

    # Part # 2
    slow = nums[0]
