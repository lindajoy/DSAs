"""
You are given a string num, representing a large integer. 
Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of num,
or an empty string "" if no odd integer exists.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Input = "52"
Output: "5"
Explanation: The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.
Example 2:

Input: num = "4206"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".
Example 3:

Input: num = "35427"
Output: "35427"
Explanation: "35427" is already an odd number.

Something you need to remember is that strings in Python are iterables!!

# First solution is the brute force algorithm that has two loops:
