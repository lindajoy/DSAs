Builds up on question on this folder: reverse_digits.py

A palindromic string is one which reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g., "redivider". 
In this problem, you are to write a program which determines if the decimal representation of an integer is a palindromic string. 
For example, your program should return true for the inputs 0,1",7,17,727,333, a:nd21.4744741.2, arrd false for the inputs -'1,12,100, and 2147483647.

A number is not an iterable...
