"""
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), 
return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

input: grid = [
["1","1","1","1","0"],
["1","1","0","1","0"],
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["0","0","0","0","0"]]

#   ðŸ’¡ One thing to note while reading the question is the directions:  
#   The question states that we should move horizontally and vertically; not diagonally ðŸ¤”
#   Another thing I have learnt is when working with any Data structure question something that should become second nature
#   is to always start by validating the input.
#   In this solution we use Breadth First search, however the depth first search can also be applied!!
