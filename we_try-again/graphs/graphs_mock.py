"""
We can picture the country as a matrix there:
    - '1' -> is a road
    - '0' -> is a farm or just a place we cannot build
    - '-1' -> is cities we want to connect

Find a path that connects all the cities (-1) together.

HMM, this question is deeper than it looks. ðŸ¤”

Question Here To the interviewer here can be:
    1. Can we assume that there will always be a path that connects all the cities together (-1)?
       i) How do we account for the case where a path cannot be formed what should we return?
    2. When returning the positions, should we we also include the positions of -1s(cities or we can just skip them)?
    3. When you say the output is positions => Should be a list of positions?  
    4. When we say the output should be a list of positions are we considering the longest path or shortest path? Because.. `THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU SHOW WHAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED ON THE DIAGRAM`

# Lets create a Pseudocode for this right?
# So how would solving it using DFS look like?
