"""
Consider an m* n grid containing cells with three potential values:

    0, which indicates an unoccupied cell
    1, representing a freshly picked orange.
    2, indicating a rotten orange.

Any fresh orange that is 4â€“directionally adjacent to a rotten orange will also turn rotten with each passing minute.
Your task is to determine the minimum time required for all cells to have rotten oranges. 
In case, this objective cannot be achieved, return -1

"""

# What does this question ask us about?
# Whats the input is the best question? Heheehe
# A matrix
# Returns how many minutes it takes for all the rotten oranges in the matrix to rot
# If the oranges are not all rotten , then we need to return -1

# One of the hints that is supposed to indicate that we should use BFS is the keyword minimum.
# One thing about BFS is that it will always return the shortest path/time/or whatever,  whenever it comes to graph problems, 
# This is the first algorithm you should think about.

# TIME COMPLEXITY IS O(N*M)
# SPACE COMPLEXITY IS O(N*M)
