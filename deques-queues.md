# Python's deque: Implement Efficient Queues and Stacks

Queues follows the first in first out principle, meaning the first element in is the first element out while deque follows the last in first out principle => Elements can be added or removed from both ends of the deque.

Deque is provided in the *collections* module, Offers methods like "append()" to add an element at the right end, "appendleft()" to add an element on the left end, "pop" to remove the element from the right hand, and "popleft" to remove an element from the left end
