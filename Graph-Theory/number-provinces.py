"""
Letâ€™s say we have n number of cities, and some of them are connected, while some are not. 
If a city A is connected directly with city B, and city B is connected directly with city C, 
then we can say that city A is connected indirectly with city C.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities with no other cities outside of the group.

An (n Ã— n) matrix, is_city_connected, is given, where is_city_connected[i][j] = 1 indicates that the ith and the jth
cities are directly connected. Otherwise, the value is is_city_connected[i][j] = 0.

Use this information to return the total number of provinces.

This question can be solved by either:
   1. BFS Pattern
   2. DFS Pattern
   3. Union Find Algorithm

ðŸ’¡ Discovered something interesting while working on this problem n*n means the number of columns and rows are equal.

The input in this case is Matrix.
The Output in this case is the Number of Total Provinces.

The value 1 indicates at the very least that the cities are connected.
The value 0 indicates that the city is not connected.
