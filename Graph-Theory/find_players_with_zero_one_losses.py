"""
You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:
You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.

matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]

Question for interviewer is it oaky for me to use the counter method from collections to create a hashmap?
ðŸ’¡ This works however, Its not an effecient solution => We need to look for a better solution
