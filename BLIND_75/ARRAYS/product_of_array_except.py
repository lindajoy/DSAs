"""
PRODUCT OF ARRAY EXCEPT SELF

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal 
to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

        for j in complete_nums:
            produt *= j
        product_array.append(produt)

    return product_array

    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] *= postfix
        postfix *= nums[i]
    return res
