   Swaping 

   Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that  when evaluating an assignment,
   the right hand side is evaluated before the left hand side.

   See Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order

   This means for the following expression a,b = b,a

   The right hand sde b, a is evaluated, that is to say, a tuple of two elements is
   createed in the memory. The two elements are the objects designated by the identifiers b and a,
   that were existing before the instruction is encountered during the execution of the program.

   Just after the  creation of this tuple, no assignment of this tuple object has still been made,
   but it doesn't matter, Python internally know where it is.

   Then, the left hand side is evaluated, that is to say, the tuple is assigned to the left side.

   As the left hand side is composed of two identifiers, the tuple is unpacked in order that the first ideni=fier a
   be assigned to the first element of the tuple (which is the object b before the swap because it had name b)
   and the second identifier b is assigned to the second element of the tuple.
