First encounter with Dynamic Programming:

What is Dynamic Programming? 

Dynamic programming technique where an algorithimic problem is first broken down
into sub problems, the results are saved and then the sub-problems are optimized to find 
the overall solution - which usually has to do with finding the maximum and minimum range of the 
algorithimic query.

INPUT HERE IS: AN ARRAY : nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

OUTPUT HERE IS THE LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCE : 4

"""
ðŸ’¡ SOLUTION ANALYSIS

Time Complexity here is Quadratic since we have two loops, 
One outer loop and one inner loop to compare the curr and prev integers.
