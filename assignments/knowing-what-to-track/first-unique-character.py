For a given string of characters, s, your task is to find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index.
Return 1 âˆ’1 if thereâ€™s no unique character in the given string.
Constraints: All letters are in lowercase.

ðŸ’¡ Example I

str = "Happy Aniversary"
First_unique_character = 0

ðŸ’¡ Example 2
str = "good morning"
First_unique_character = 2 (ðŸ¤” Hapa Sijaelewa)

The input in this case is a string and the output is the index of a unique character

=> Using Counter:
Counter is a subclass of dict thatâ€™s specially designed for counting hashable objects in Python. 
Itâ€™s a dictionary that stores objects as keys and counts as values. To count with Counter, 
you typically provide a sequence or iterable of hashable objects as an argument to the classâ€™s constructor.
