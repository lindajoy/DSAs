Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Difference between a subsequence and a substring:

1) A substring - a contiguous(continuous) sequence of characters present within a string. 
                   It is a string present inside a string.

2) A subsequence  - is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence of elements 
                    without changing the order of the remaining elements

For Example: {A, B, D} is one of the subsequences of the sequence {A, B, C, D, E} obtained after removing {C} and {E}.
